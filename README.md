## Introduction ##

Hello and welcome.

This is an API designed for the frontend of Piiquante.
It is meant to connect the website to the mongo database and handle the user and sauce requests.


## Usage ##

First, if you cloned this folder from the github repository, you will need to install the modules listed in `package.json`(except for openssl) with `npm install "module name here"`.

Run `nodemon server`(or `node server`) in the backend folder. This should start the API on your port 3000 by default.

If it worked, you should see the port and a confirmation of connection to MongoDB in the terminal.

The API should reload automatically when you make a change to a file.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.
